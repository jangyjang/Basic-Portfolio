		<h2>About me</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/CY-Work.jpg" width="200px">
		<p> Hello! My name is Jang. I was born and raised in Thailand. I moved to Chicago in January 2011. It was a few day before a blizzard hit Chicago. I thought that was completely normal</p>
		<p>I love travelling. I went to 6 countries plus Hawaii, Alaska and NYC in the past 12 months.</p>
		<p>I enjoy my Coding Boot Camp class a lot. It gives joy of doing something I've always loved; problem solving. Time flies when I am doing this. It's been a lot of fun!</p>
